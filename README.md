Hello, I'm Serj! I'm a self-taught developer and an MIS undergraduate student. 

As a developer, I'm interested in application development and designing database schemas with implementation, with a little bit of web development. I also play Classical Guitar on the side, and have huge interest in Dan Brown and the topics he writes his stores about.

**My Major Projects:**
- [pSearch](https://github.com/SerjSX/pSearch): a searching tool built with Python and CustomTkinter that scrapes piracy related websites using BeautifulSoup and displays the result in a way that's clear to be seen. Primary skills: Python, Tkinter and CustomTkinter, BeautifulSoup, connecting to websites.
- [eCommerce Web Development - polyphonic](https://github.com/SerjSX/polyphonic-ecommerce): a web development project, both frontend (html, css - tailwindcss component -, js - jquery) and backend (nodejs, expressjs, bcrypt, mongodb), focusing on a website where many stores can sign up, sell products, and take orders from customers who can browse the products and add them to cart to order later. The payment process is not available as it was not at the scope of this web development project.
- [Projects on Data Analaysis with Python](https://github.com/SerjSX/Python-for-Data-Analysis-Projects): These are my solutions to the Python for Data Analaysis course on freeCodeCamp and the projects they had required me to do.
